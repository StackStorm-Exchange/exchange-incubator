# Maps Service Alerts (LMS) to an action

# TROUBLESHOOTING
# On the LogicMonitor side, your Stackstorm Integration’s POST payload should include the appropriate
# object (key/value pair) for your rule's criteria. Ensure the key/value pair indicated in the Rule's
# criteria section exists in the payload being sent to the webhook-sensor.
#
# The default payload object contains the { ... “type”:”##ALERTTYPE##” ... } key/value pair which will
# satisfy the above rule's criteria.
