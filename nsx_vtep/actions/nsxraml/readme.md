# NSX for vSphere RAML

This repository holds a RAML specification of the NSX for vSphere 6.x API.
For more details on RAML, please visit http://raml.org.

This RAML file has been generated from information that can be found in the "NSX vSphere API Guide" documentation that is  available in PDF format at vmware.com.

The purpose of this package is to be used as the basis in building dynamic API clients for the NSX for vSphere API and for the automatic generation of API documentation.

An example of one such dynamic client that uses the NSX RAML specification is the Python 'nsxramlclient' that can be found at:
http://github.com/vmware/nsxramlclient

In addition to the RAML file itself, several artifacts are provided that are generated by the tools raml2html, raml2md, raml-fleece and raml2postman:
- In /html-version/ there is a dynamic HTML file generated by raml2html that can be viewed in a browser. There is also a static HTML file generated by raml-fleece that can be converted to a single page PDF documentation file.
- Likewise, /md-version/ contains a markdown file generated by raml2md.
- Finally, in /postman-collection/ there are postman collection and postman environments files generated by raml2postman

You can find more information on the raml2html and raml2md tools on Kevin Renkser's Github

Details on raml2postman can be found on postmanlabs github

# Building

If you are interested in building the artifacts you will need a modified version of raml2html and raml2postman. To install these globally use the following commands:

    npm install -g https://github.com/yfauser/raml2html

    npm install -g https://github.com/yfauser/raml2postman

*Note that if you want a local install do not supply the -g argument.*

You will also need to install raml-fleece. To install it globally use the following command:

    npm install -g raml-fleece

Once the pre-requisites packages are installed you can run the following script:

    create_artifacts.sh
