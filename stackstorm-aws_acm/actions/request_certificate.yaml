  IdempotencyToken:
    type: string
    description: "Customer chosen string that can be used to distinguish between calls to RequestCertificate. Idempotency tokens time out after one hour. Therefore, if you call RequestCertificate multiple times with the same idempotency token within one hour, ACM recognizes that you are requesting only one certificate and will issue only one. If you change the idempotency token for each call, ACM recognizes that you are requesting multiple certificates."

This must be the same as the Domain value or a superdomain of the Domain value.
