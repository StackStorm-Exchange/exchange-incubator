  StackName:
    type: string
    description: "The name that is associated with the stack. The name must be unique in the region in which you are creating the stack.  A stack name can contain only alphanumeric characters (case sensitive) and hyphens. It must start with an alphabetic character and cannot be longer than 128 characters. "
    required: true
  TemplateBody:
    type: string
    description: "Structure containing the template body with a minimum length of 1 byte and a maximum length of 51,200 bytes. For more information, go to Template Anatomy in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide. Conditional: You must specify either the TemplateBody or the TemplateURL parameter, but not both."
  TemplateURL:
    type: string
    description: "Location of file containing the template body. The URL must point to a template (max size: 460,800 bytes) that is located in an Amazon S3 bucket. For more information, go to the Template Anatomy in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide. Conditional: You must specify either the TemplateBody or the TemplateURL parameter, but not both."
  Parameters:
    type: array
    description: "A list of Parameter structures that specify input parameters for the stack. For more information, see the Parameter data type."
  DisableRollback:
    type: boolean
    description: "Set to true to disable rollback of the stack if stack creation failed. You can specify either DisableRollback or OnFailure, but not both. Default: false "
  TimeoutInMinutes:
    type: integer
    description: "The amount of time that can pass before the stack status becomes CREATE_FAILED; if DisableRollback is not set or is set to false, the stack will be rolled back."
  NotificationARNs:
    type: array
    description: "The Simple Notification Service (SNS) topic ARNs to publish stack related events. You can find your SNS topic ARNs using the SNS console or your Command Line Interface (CLI)."
  Capabilities:
    type: array
    description: "A list of values that you must specify before AWS CloudFormation can create certain stacks. Some stack templates might include resources that can affect permissions in your AWS account, for example, by creating new AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. For those stacks, you must explicitly acknowledge their capabilities by specifying this parameter. The only valid values are CAPABILITY_IAM and CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM. The following resources require you to specify this parameter:  AWS::IAM::AccessKey,  AWS::IAM::Group,  AWS::IAM::InstanceProfile,  AWS::IAM::Policy,  AWS::IAM::Role,  AWS::IAM::User, and  AWS::IAM::UserToGroupAddition. If your stack template contains these resources, we recommend that you review all permissions associated with them and edit their permissions if necessary. If you have IAM resources, you can specify either capability. If you have IAM resources with custom names, you must specify CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM. If you don't specify this parameter, this action returns an InsufficientCapabilities error. For more information, see Acknowledging IAM Resources in AWS CloudFormation Templates."
  ResourceTypes:
    type: array
    description: "The template resource types that you have permissions to work with for this create stack action, such as AWS::EC2::Instance, AWS::EC2::*, or Custom::MyCustomInstance. Use the following syntax to describe template resource types: AWS::* (for all AWS resource), Custom::* (for all custom resources), Custom::logical_ID  (for a specific custom resource), AWS::service_name::* (for all resources of a particular AWS service), and AWS::service_name::resource_logical_ID  (for a specific AWS resource). If the list of resource types doesn't include a resource that you're creating, the stack creation fails. By default, AWS CloudFormation grants permissions to all resource types. AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) uses this parameter for AWS CloudFormation-specific condition keys in IAM policies. For more information, see Controlling Access with AWS Identity and Access Management."
  OnFailure:
    type: string
    description: "Determines what action will be taken if stack creation fails. This must be one of: DO_NOTHING, ROLLBACK, or DELETE. You can specify either OnFailure or DisableRollback, but not both. Default: ROLLBACK "
  StackPolicyBody:
    type: string
    description: "Structure containing the stack policy body. For more information, go to  Prevent Updates to Stack Resources in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide. You can specify either the StackPolicyBody or the StackPolicyURL parameter, but not both."
  StackPolicyURL:
    type: string
    description: "Location of a file containing the stack policy. The URL must point to a policy (max size: 16KB) located in an S3 bucket in the same region as the stack. You can specify either the StackPolicyBody or the StackPolicyURL parameter, but not both."
  Tags:
    type: array
    description: "Key-value pairs to associate with this stack. AWS CloudFormation also propagates these tags to the resources created in the stack. A maximum number of 10 tags can be specified."
