    description: "For stacks in the DELETE_FAILED state, a list of resource logical IDs that are associated with the resources you want to retain. During deletion, AWS CloudFormation deletes the stack but does not delete the retained resources. Retaining resources is useful when you cannot delete a resource, such as a non-empty S3 bucket, but you want to delete the stack."
