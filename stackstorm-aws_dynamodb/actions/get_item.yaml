  TableName:
    type: string
    description: "The name of the table containing the requested item."
    required: true
  Key:
    type: object
    description: "A map of attribute names to AttributeValue objects, representing the primary key of the item to retrieve. For the primary key, you must provide all of the attributes. For example, with a simple primary key, you only need to provide a value for the partition key. For a composite primary key, you must provide values for both the partition key and the sort key."
    required: true
  AttributesToGet:
    type: array
    description: " This is a legacy parameter, for backward compatibility. New applications should use ProjectionExpression instead. Do not combine legacy parameters and expression parameters in a single API call; otherwise, DynamoDB will return a ValidationException exception. This parameter allows you to retrieve attributes of type List or Map; however, it cannot retrieve individual elements within a List or a Map.  The names of one or more attributes to retrieve. If no attribute names are provided, then all attributes will be returned. If any of the requested attributes are not found, they will not appear in the result. Note that AttributesToGet has no effect on provisioned throughput consumption. DynamoDB determines capacity units consumed based on item size, not on the amount of data that is returned to an application."
  ConsistentRead:
    type: boolean
    description: "Determines the read consistency model: If set to true, then the operation uses strongly consistent reads; otherwise, the operation uses eventually consistent reads."
  ReturnConsumedCapacity:
    type: string
    description: ""
  ProjectionExpression:
    type: string
    description: "A string that identifies one or more attributes to retrieve from the table. These attributes can include scalars, sets, or elements of a JSON document. The attributes in the expression must be separated by commas. If no attribute names are specified, then all attributes will be returned. If any of the requested attributes are not found, they will not appear in the result. For more information, see Accessing Item Attributes in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.   ProjectionExpression replaces the legacy AttributesToGet parameter. "
  ExpressionAttributeNames:
    type: object
    description: "One or more substitution tokens for attribute names in an expression. The following are some use cases for using ExpressionAttributeNames:   To access an attribute whose name conflicts with a DynamoDB reserved word.   To create a placeholder for repeating occurrences of an attribute name in an expression.   To prevent special characters in an attribute name from being misinterpreted in an expression.   Use the # character in an expression to dereference an attribute name. For example, consider the following attribute name:    Percentile    The name of this attribute conflicts with a reserved word, so it cannot be used directly in an expression. (For the complete list of reserved words, see Reserved Words in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide). To work around this, you could specify the following for ExpressionAttributeNames:    {'#P':'Percentile'}    You could then use this substitution in an expression, as in this example:    #P = :val     Tokens that begin with the : character are expression attribute values, which are placeholders for the actual value at runtime.  For more information on expression attribute names, see Accessing Item Attributes in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide."
