    immutable: true

  SourceRegion:
    type: string
    description: "The ID of the region that contains the snapshot to be copied."
    required: true
  SourceSnapshotId:
    type: string
    description: "The ID of the EBS snapshot to copy."
    required: true
  DryRun:
    type: boolean
    description: "Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRunOperation. Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation."
  Description:
    type: string
    description: "A description for the EBS snapshot."
  DestinationRegion:
    type: string
    description: "The destination region to use in the PresignedUrl parameter of a snapshot copy operation. This parameter is only valid for specifying the destination region in a PresignedUrl parameter, where it is required.   CopySnapshot sends the snapshot copy to the regional endpoint that you send the HTTP request to, such as ec2.us-east-1.amazonaws.com (in the AWS CLI, this is specified with the --region parameter or the default region in your AWS configuration file). "
  PresignedUrl:
    type: string
    description: "The pre-signed URL that facilitates copying an encrypted snapshot. This parameter is only required when copying an encrypted snapshot with the Amazon EC2 Query API; it is available as an optional parameter in all other cases. The PresignedUrl should use the snapshot source endpoint, the CopySnapshot action, and include the SourceRegion, SourceSnapshotId, and DestinationRegion parameters. The PresignedUrl must be signed using AWS Signature Version 4. Because EBS snapshots are stored in Amazon S3, the signing algorithm for this parameter uses the same logic that is described in Authenticating Requests by Using Query Parameters (AWS Signature Version 4) in the Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference. An invalid or improperly signed PresignedUrl will cause the copy operation to fail asynchronously, and the snapshot will move to an error state."
  Encrypted:
    type: boolean
    description: "Specifies whether the destination snapshot should be encrypted. You can encrypt a copy of an unencrypted snapshot using this flag, but you cannot use it to create an unencrypted copy from an encrypted snapshot. Your default CMK for EBS is used unless a non-default AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) CMK is specified with KmsKeyId. For more information, see Amazon EBS Encryption in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide."
  KmsKeyId:
    type: string
    description: "The full ARN of the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) CMK to use when creating the snapshot copy. This parameter is only required if you want to use a non-default CMK; if this parameter is not specified, the default CMK for EBS is used. The ARN contains the arn:aws:kms namespace, followed by the region of the CMK, the AWS account ID of the CMK owner, the key namespace, and then the CMK ID. For example, arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:012345678910:key/abcd1234-a123-456a-a12b-a123b4cd56ef. The specified CMK must exist in the region that the snapshot is being copied to. If a KmsKeyId is specified, the Encrypted flag must also be set."
