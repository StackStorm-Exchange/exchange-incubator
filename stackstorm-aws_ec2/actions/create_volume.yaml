  AvailabilityZone:
    type: string
    description: "The Availability Zone in which to create the volume. Use DescribeAvailabilityZones to list the Availability Zones that are currently available to you."
    required: true
  DryRun:
    type: boolean
    description: "Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRunOperation. Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation."
  Size:
    type: integer
    description: "The size of the volume, in GiBs. Constraints: 1-16384 for gp2, 4-16384 for io1, 500-16384 for st1, 500-16384 for sc1, and 1-1024 for standard. If you specify a snapshot, the volume size must be equal to or larger than the snapshot size. Default: If you're creating the volume from a snapshot and don't specify a volume size, the default is the snapshot size."
  SnapshotId:
    type: string
    description: "The snapshot from which to create the volume."
  VolumeType:
    type: string
    description: "The volume type. This can be gp2 for General Purpose SSD, io1 for Provisioned IOPS SSD, st1 for Throughput Optimized HDD, sc1 for Cold HDD, or standard for Magnetic volumes. Default: standard "
  Iops:
    type: integer
    description: "Only valid for Provisioned IOPS SSD volumes. The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS) to provision for the volume, with a maximum ratio of 30 IOPS/GiB. Constraint: Range is 100 to 20000 for Provisioned IOPS SSD volumes "
  Encrypted:
    type: boolean
    description: "Specifies whether the volume should be encrypted. Encrypted Amazon EBS volumes may only be attached to instances that support Amazon EBS encryption. Volumes that are created from encrypted snapshots are automatically encrypted. There is no way to create an encrypted volume from an unencrypted snapshot or vice versa. If your AMI uses encrypted volumes, you can only launch it on supported instance types. For more information, see Amazon EBS Encryption in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide."
  KmsKeyId:
    type: string
    description: "The full ARN of the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master key (CMK) to use when creating the encrypted volume. This parameter is only required if you want to use a non-default CMK; if this parameter is not specified, the default CMK for EBS is used. The ARN contains the arn:aws:kms namespace, followed by the region of the CMK, the AWS account ID of the CMK owner, the key namespace, and then the CMK ID. For example, arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:012345678910:key/abcd1234-a123-456a-a12b-a123b4cd56ef. If a KmsKeyId is specified, the Encrypted flag must also be set."
