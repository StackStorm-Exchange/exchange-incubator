  Filters:
    type: array
    description: "One or more filters.    attachment.state - The current state of the attachment between the gateway and the VPC (available). Present only if a VPC is attached.    attachment.vpc-id - The ID of an attached VPC.    internet-gateway-id - The ID of the Internet gateway.    tag:key=value - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource.    tag-key - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is independent of the tag-value filter. For example, if you use both the filter 'tag-key=Purpose' and the filter 'tag-value=X', you get any resources assigned both the tag key Purpose (regardless of what the tag's value is), and the tag value X (regardless of what the tag's key is). If you want to list only resources where Purpose is X, see the tag:key=value filter.    tag-value - The value of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is independent of the tag-key filter.  "
