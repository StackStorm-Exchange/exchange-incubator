  Filters:
    type: array
    description: "One or more filters.    accepter-vpc-info.cidr-block - The CIDR block of the peer VPC.    accepter-vpc-info.owner-id - The AWS account ID of the owner of the peer VPC.    accepter-vpc-info.vpc-id - The ID of the peer VPC.    expiration-time - The expiration date and time for the VPC peering connection.    requester-vpc-info.cidr-block - The CIDR block of the requester's VPC.    requester-vpc-info.owner-id - The AWS account ID of the owner of the requester VPC.    requester-vpc-info.vpc-id - The ID of the requester VPC.    status-code - The status of the VPC peering connection (pending-acceptance | failed | expired | provisioning | active | deleted | rejected).    status-message - A message that provides more information about the status of the VPC peering connection, if applicable.    tag:key=value - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource.    tag-key - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is independent of the tag-value filter. For example, if you use both the filter 'tag-key=Purpose' and the filter 'tag-value=X', you get any resources assigned both the tag key Purpose (regardless of what the tag's value is), and the tag value X (regardless of what the tag's key is). If you want to list only resources where Purpose is X, see the tag:key=value filter.    tag-value - The value of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is independent of the tag-key filter.    vpc-peering-connection-id - The ID of the VPC peering connection.  "
