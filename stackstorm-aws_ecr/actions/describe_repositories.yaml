  maxResults:
    type: integer
    description: "The maximum number of repository results returned by DescribeRepositories in paginated output.

The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending another DescribeRepositories request with the returned nextToken value. This value can be between 1 and 100. If this parameter is not used, then DescribeRepositories returns up to 100 results and a nextToken value, if applicable."
