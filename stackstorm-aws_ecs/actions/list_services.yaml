  nextToken:
    type: string
    description: "The nextToken value returned from a previous paginated ListServices request where maxResults was used and the results exceeded the value of that parameter. Pagination continues from the end of the previous results that returned the nextToken value. This value is null when there are no more results to return.  This token should be treated as an opaque identifier that is only used to retrieve the next items in a list and not for other programmatic purposes. "
  maxResults:
    type: integer
    description: "The maximum number of container instance results returned by ListServices in paginated output. When this parameter is used, ListServices only returns maxResults results in a single page along with a nextToken response element. The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending another ListServices request with the returned nextToken value. This value can be between 1 and 10. If this parameter is not used, then ListServices returns up to 10 results and a nextToken value if applicable."
