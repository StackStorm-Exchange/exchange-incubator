  familyPrefix:
    type: string
    description: "The familyPrefix is a string that is used to filter the results of ListTaskDefinitionFamilies. If you specify a familyPrefix, only task definition family names that begin with the familyPrefix string are returned."
  status:
    type: string
    description: "The task definition family status with which to filter the ListTaskDefinitionFamilies results. By default, both ACTIVE and INACTIVE task definition families are listed. If this parameter is set to ACTIVE, only task definition families that have an ACTIVE task definition revision are returned. If this parameter is set to INACTIVE, only task definition families that do not have any ACTIVE task definition revisions are returned. If you paginate the resulting output, be sure to keep the status value constant in each subsequent request."
  nextToken:
    type: string
    description: "The nextToken value returned from a previous paginated ListTaskDefinitionFamilies request where maxResults was used and the results exceeded the value of that parameter. Pagination continues from the end of the previous results that returned the nextToken value. This value is null when there are no more results to return.  This token should be treated as an opaque identifier that is only used to retrieve the next items in a list and not for other programmatic purposes. "
  maxResults:
    type: integer
    description: "The maximum number of task definition family results returned by ListTaskDefinitionFamilies in paginated output. When this parameter is used, ListTaskDefinitions only returns maxResults results in a single page along with a nextToken response element. The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending another ListTaskDefinitionFamilies request with the returned nextToken value. This value can be between 1 and 100. If this parameter is not used, then ListTaskDefinitionFamilies returns up to 100 results and a nextToken value if applicable."
