  CacheClusterId:
    type: string
    description: "The cache cluster identifier. This value is stored as a lowercase string."
    required: true
  NumCacheNodes:
    type: integer
    description: "The number of cache nodes that the cache cluster should have. If the value for NumCacheNodes is greater than the sum of the number of current cache nodes and the number of cache nodes pending creation (which may be zero), then more nodes will be added. If the value is less than the number of existing cache nodes, then nodes will be removed. If the value is equal to the number of current cache nodes, then any pending add or remove requests are canceled. If you are removing cache nodes, you must use the CacheNodeIdsToRemove parameter to provide the IDs of the specific cache nodes to remove. For clusters running Redis, this value must be 1. For clusters running Memcached, this value must be between 1 and 20.  Adding or removing Memcached cache nodes can be applied immediately or as a pending action. See ApplyImmediately. A pending action to modify the number of cache nodes in a cluster during its maintenance window, whether by adding or removing nodes in accordance with the scale out architecture, is not queued. The customer's latest request to add or remove nodes to the cluster overrides any previous pending actions to modify the number of cache nodes in the cluster. For example, a request to remove 2 nodes would override a previous pending action to remove 3 nodes. Similarly, a request to add 2 nodes would override a previous pending action to remove 3 nodes and vice versa. As Memcached cache nodes may now be provisioned in different Availability Zones with flexible cache node placement, a request to add nodes does not automatically override a previous pending action to add nodes. The customer can modify the previous pending action to add more nodes or explicitly cancel the pending request and retry the new request. To cancel pending actions to modify the number of cache nodes in a cluster, use the ModifyCacheCluster request and set NumCacheNodes equal to the number of cache nodes currently in the cache cluster.

  CacheNodeIdsToRemove:
    type: array
    description: "A list of cache node IDs to be removed. A node ID is a numeric identifier (0001, 0002, etc.). This parameter is only valid when NumCacheNodes is less than the existing number of cache nodes. The number of cache node IDs supplied in this parameter must match the difference between the existing number of cache nodes in the cluster or pending cache nodes, whichever is greater, and the value of NumCacheNodes in the request. For example: If you have 3 active cache nodes, 7 pending cache nodes, and the number of cache nodes in this ModifyCacheCluser call is 5, you must list 2 (7 - 5) cache node IDs to remove."
  AZMode:
    type: string
    description: "Specifies whether the new nodes in this Memcached cache cluster are all created in a single Availability Zone or created across multiple Availability Zones. Valid values: single-az | cross-az. This option is only supported for Memcached cache clusters.  You cannot specify single-az if the Memcached cache cluster already has cache nodes in different Availability Zones. If cross-az is specified, existing Memcached nodes remain in their current Availability Zone. Only newly created nodes will be located in different Availability Zones. For instructions on how to move existing Memcached nodes to different Availability Zones, see the Availability Zone Considerations section of Cache Node Considerations for Memcached. "
  NewAvailabilityZones:
    type: array
    description: "The list of Availability Zones where the new Memcached cache nodes will be created. This parameter is only valid when NumCacheNodes in the request is greater than the sum of the number of active cache nodes and the number of cache nodes pending creation (which may be zero). The number of Availability Zones supplied in this list must match the cache nodes being added in this request. This option is only supported on Memcached clusters. Scenarios:    Scenario 1: You have 3 active nodes and wish to add 2 nodes. Specify NumCacheNodes=5 (3 + 2) and optionally specify two Availability Zones for the two new nodes.    Scenario 2: You have 3 active nodes and 2 nodes pending creation (from the scenario 1 call) and want to add 1 more node. Specify NumCacheNodes=6 ((3 + 2) + 1) and optionally specify an Availability Zone for the new node.    Scenario 3: You want to cancel all pending actions. Specify NumCacheNodes=3 to cancel all pending actions.   The Availability Zone placement of nodes pending creation cannot be modified. If you wish to cancel any nodes pending creation, add 0 nodes by setting NumCacheNodes to the number of current nodes. If cross-az is specified, existing Memcached nodes remain in their current Availability Zone. Only newly created nodes can be located in different Availability Zones. For guidance on how to move existing Memcached nodes to different Availability Zones, see the Availability Zone Considerations section of Cache Node Considerations for Memcached.  Impact of new add/remove requests upon pending requests    Scenario-1   Pending Action: Delete   New Request: Delete   Result: The new delete, pending or immediate, replaces the pending delete.     Scenario-2   Pending Action: Delete   New Request: Create   Result: The new create, pending or immediate, replaces the pending delete.     Scenario-3   Pending Action: Create   New Request: Delete   Result: The new delete, pending or immediate, replaces the pending create.     Scenario-4   Pending Action: Create   New Request: Create   Result: The new create is added to the pending create.   Important: If the new create request is Apply Immediately - Yes, all creates are performed immediately. If the new create request is Apply Immediately - No, all creates are pending.      Example:  NewAvailabilityZones.member.1=us-west-2a&amp;amp;NewAvailabilityZones.member.2=us-west-2b&amp;amp;NewAvailabilityZones.member.3=us-west-2c "
