  OutputBucket:
    type: string
    description: "The Amazon S3 bucket in which you want Elastic Transcoder to save the transcoded files. (Use this, or use ContentConfig:Bucket plus ThumbnailConfig:Bucket.) Specify this value when all of the following are true:  You want to save transcoded files, thumbnails (if any), and playlists (if any) together in one bucket. You do not want to specify the users or groups who have access to the transcoded files, thumbnails, and playlists. You do not want to specify the permissions that Elastic Transcoder grants to the files. When Elastic Transcoder saves files in OutputBucket, it grants full control over the files only to the AWS account that owns the role that is specified by Role. You want to associate the transcoded files and thumbnails with the Amazon S3 Standard storage class.  If you want to save transcoded files and playlists in one bucket and thumbnails in another bucket, specify which users can access the transcoded files or the permissions the users have, or change the Amazon S3 storage class, omit OutputBucket and specify values for ContentConfig and ThumbnailConfig instead."

    description: "The AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key that you want to use with this pipeline. If you use either S3 or S3-AWS-KMS as your Encryption:Mode, you don't need to provide a key with your job because a default key, known as an AWS-KMS key, is created for you automatically. You need to provide an AWS-KMS key only if you want to use a non-default AWS-KMS key, or if you are using an Encryption:Mode of AES-PKCS7, AES-CTR, or AES-GCM."
