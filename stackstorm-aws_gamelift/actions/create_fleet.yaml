    description: "Descriptive label associated with a fleet. Fleet names do not need to be unique."
    required: true
  BuildId:
    type: string
    description: "Unique identifier of the build to be deployed on the new fleet. The build must have been successfully uploaded to GameLift and be in a READY state. This fleet setting cannot be changed once the fleet is created."
    required: true
  EC2InstanceType:
    type: string
    description: "Name of an EC2 instance type that is supported in Amazon GameLift. A fleet instance type determines the computing resources of each instance in the fleet, including CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity. GameLift supports the following EC2 instance types. See Amazon EC2 Instance Types for detailed descriptions."
    required: true
  Description:
    type: string
    description: "Human-readable description of a fleet."
  ServerLaunchPath:
    type: string
    description: "This parameter is no longer used. Instead, specify a server launch path using the RuntimeConfiguration parameter. (Requests that specify a server launch path and launch parameters instead of a runtime configuration will continue to work.)"
  ServerLaunchParameters:
    type: string
    description: "This parameter is no longer used. Instead, specify server launch parameters in the RuntimeConfiguration parameter. (Requests that specify a server launch path and launch parameters instead of a runtime configuration will continue to work.)"
  LogPaths:
    type: array
    description: "Location of default log files. When a server process is shut down, Amazon GameLift captures and stores any log files in this location. These logs are in addition to game session logs; see more on game session logs in the Amazon GameLift Developer Guide. If no default log path for a fleet is specified, GameLift will automatically upload logs stored on each instance at C:\\game\\logs. Use the GameLift console to access stored logs. "
  EC2InboundPermissions:
    type: array
    description: "Range of IP addresses and port settings that permit inbound traffic to access server processes running on the fleet. If no inbound permissions are set, including both IP address range and port range, the server processes in the fleet cannot accept connections. You can specify one or more sets of permissions for a fleet."
  NewGameSessionProtectionPolicy:
    type: string
    description: "Game session protection policy to apply to all instances in this fleet. If this parameter is not set, instances in this fleet default to no protection. You can change a fleet's protection policy using UpdateFleetAttributes, but this change will only affect sessions created after the policy change. You can also set protection for individual instances using UpdateGameSession. NoProtection – The game session can be terminated during a scale-down event. FullProtection – If the game session is in an ACTIVE status, it cannot be terminated during a scale-down event."
  RuntimeConfiguration:
    type: object
    description: "Instructions for launching server processes on each instance in the fleet. The runtime configuration for a fleet has a collection of server process configurations, one for each type of server process to run on an instance. A server process configuration specifies the location of the server executable, launch parameters, and the number of concurrent processes with that configuration to maintain on each instance. A CreateFleet request must include a runtime configuration with at least one server process configuration; otherwise the request will fail with an invalid request exception. (This parameter replaces the parameters ServerLaunchPath and ServerLaunchParameters; requests that contain values for these parameters instead of a runtime configuration will continue to work.) "
