  NewPassword:
    type: string
    description: "The new password. The new password must conform to the AWS account's password policy, if one exists. The regex pattern for this parameter is a string of characters consisting of almost any printable ASCII character from the space (\\u0020) through the end of the ASCII character range (\\u00FF). You can also include the tab (\\u0009), line feed (\\u000A), and carriage return (\\u000D) characters. Although any of these characters are valid in a password, note that many tools, such as the AWS Management Console, might restrict the ability to enter certain characters because they have special meaning within that tool."
