  PolicyArn:
    type: string
    description: "The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM policy for which you want the versions. For more information about ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and AWS Service Namespaces in the AWS General Reference."
    required: true
  EntityFilter:
    type: string
    description: "The entity type to use for filtering the results. For example, when EntityFilter is Role, only the roles that are attached to the specified policy are returned. This parameter is optional. If it is not included, all attached entities (users, groups, and roles) are returned. The argument for this parameter must be one of the valid values listed below."
  PathPrefix:
    type: string
    description: "The path prefix for filtering the results. This parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a slash (/), listing all entities. The regex pattern for this parameter is a string of characters consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself or a string that must begin and end with forward slashes, containing any ASCII character from the ! (\\u0021) thru the DEL character (\\u007F), including most punctuation characters, digits, and upper and lowercased letters."
  Marker:
    type: string
    description: "Use this parameter only when paginating results and only after you receive a response indicating that the results are truncated. Set it to the value of the Marker element in the response that you received to indicate where the next call should start."
  MaxItems:
    type: integer
    description: "Use this only when paginating results to indicate the maximum number of items you want in the response. If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the IsTruncated response element is true. This parameter is optional. If you do not include it, it defaults to 100. Note that IAM might return fewer results, even when there are more results available. In that case, the IsTruncated response element returns true and Marker contains a value to include in the subsequent call that tells the service where to continue from."
