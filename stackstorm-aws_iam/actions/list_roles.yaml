  PathPrefix:
    type: string
    description: " The path prefix for filtering the results. For example, the prefix /application_abc/component_xyz/ gets all roles whose path starts with /application_abc/component_xyz/. This parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a slash (/), listing all roles. The regex pattern for this parameter is a string of characters consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself or a string that must begin and end with forward slashes, containing any ASCII character from the ! (\\u0021) thru the DEL character (\\u007F), including most punctuation characters, digits, and upper and lowercased letters."
  Marker:
    type: string
    description: "Use this parameter only when paginating results and only after you receive a response indicating that the results are truncated. Set it to the value of the Marker element in the response that you received to indicate where the next call should start."
  MaxItems:
    type: integer
    description: "Use this only when paginating results to indicate the maximum number of items you want in the response. If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the IsTruncated response element is true. This parameter is optional. If you do not include it, it defaults to 100. Note that IAM might return fewer results, even when there are more results available. In that case, the IsTruncated response element returns true and Marker contains a value to include in the subsequent call that tells the service where to continue from."
