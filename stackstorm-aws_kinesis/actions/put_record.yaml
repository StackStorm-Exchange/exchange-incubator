  StreamName:
    type: string
    description: "The name of the stream to put the data record into."
    required: true
  Data:
    type: string
    description: "The data blob to put into the record, which is base64-encoded when the blob is serialized. When the data blob (the payload before base64-encoding) is added to the partition key size, the total size must not exceed the maximum record size (1 MB). "
    required: true
  PartitionKey:
    type: string
    description: "Determines which shard in the stream the data record is assigned to. Partition keys are Unicode strings with a maximum length limit of 256 characters for each key. Amazon Kinesis uses the partition key as input to a hash function that maps the partition key and associated data to a specific shard. Specifically, an MD5 hash function is used to map partition keys to 128-bit integer values and to map associated data records to shards. As a result of this hashing mechanism, all data records with the same partition key map to the same shard within the stream."
    required: true
  ExplicitHashKey:
    type: string
    description: "The hash value used to explicitly determine the shard the data record is assigned to by overriding the partition key hash."
  SequenceNumberForOrdering:
    type: string
    description: "Guarantees strictly increasing sequence numbers, for puts from the same client and to the same partition key. Usage: set the SequenceNumberForOrdering of record n to the sequence number of record n-1 (as returned in the result when putting record n-1). If this parameter is not set, records will be coarsely ordered based on arrival time."
