If you are using versioning, you can also provide a qualified function ARN (ARN that is qualified with function version or alias name as suffix). For more information about versioning, see AWS Lambda Function Versioning and Aliases  AWS Lambda also allows you to specify only the function name with the account ID qualifier (for example, account-id:Thumbnail).
