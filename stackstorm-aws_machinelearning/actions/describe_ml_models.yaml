    description: "Use one of the following variables to filter a list of MLModel:   CreatedAt - Sets the search criteria to MLModel creation date.  Status - Sets the search criteria to MLModel status.  Name - Sets the search criteria to the contents of MLModel  Name.  IAMUser - Sets the search criteria to the user account that invoked the MLModel creation.  TrainingDataSourceId - Sets the search criteria to the DataSource used to train one or more MLModel.  RealtimeEndpointStatus - Sets the search criteria to the MLModel real-time endpoint status.  MLModelType - Sets the search criteria to MLModel type: binary, regression, or multi-class.  Algorithm - Sets the search criteria to the algorithm that the MLModel uses.  TrainingDataURI - Sets the search criteria to the data file(s) used in training a MLModel. The URL can identify either a file or an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket or directory. "

  SortOrder:
    type: string
    description: "A two-value parameter that determines the sequence of the resulting list of MLModel.   asc - Arranges the list in ascending order (A-Z, 0-9).  dsc - Arranges the list in descending order (Z-A, 9-0).  Results are sorted by FilterVariable."
