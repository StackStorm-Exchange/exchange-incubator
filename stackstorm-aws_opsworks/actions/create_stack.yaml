    required: true
  ServiceRoleArn:
    type: string
    description: "The stack's AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role, which allows AWS OpsWorks to work with AWS resources on your behalf. You must set this parameter to the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for an existing IAM role. For more information about IAM ARNs, see Using Identifiers."
    required: true

  VpcId:
    type: string
    description: "The ID of the VPC that the stack is to be launched into. The VPC must be in the stack's region. All instances are launched into this VPC. You cannot change the ID later.   If your account supports EC2-Classic, the default value is no VPC.   If your account does not support EC2-Classic, the default value is the default VPC for the specified region.   If the VPC ID corresponds to a default VPC and you have specified either the DefaultAvailabilityZone or the DefaultSubnetId parameter only, AWS OpsWorks infers the value of the other parameter. If you specify neither parameter, AWS OpsWorks sets these parameters to the first valid Availability Zone for the specified region and the corresponding default VPC subnet ID, respectively. If you specify a nondefault VPC ID, note the following:   It must belong to a VPC in your account that is in the specified region.   You must specify a value for DefaultSubnetId.   For more information on how to use AWS OpsWorks with a VPC, see Running a Stack in a VPC. For more information on default VPC and EC2-Classic, see Supported Platforms. "

For more information on the supported operating systems, see AWS OpsWorks Operating Systems."
  HostnameTheme:
    type: string
    description: "The stack's host name theme, with spaces replaced by underscores. The theme is used to generate host names for the stack's instances. By default, HostnameTheme is set to Layer_Dependent, which creates host names by appending integers to the layer's short name. The other themes are:    Baked_Goods     Clouds     Europe_Cities     Fruits     Greek_Deities     Legendary_creatures_from_Japan     Planets_and_Moons     Roman_Deities     Scottish_Islands     US_Cities     Wild_Cats    To obtain a generated host name, call GetHostNameSuggestion, which returns a host name based on the current theme."
  DefaultAvailabilityZone:
    type: string
    description: "The stack's default Availability Zone, which must be in the specified region. For more information, see Regions and Endpoints. If you also specify a value for DefaultSubnetId, the subnet must be in the same zone. For more information, see the VpcId parameter description. "
  DefaultSubnetId:
    type: string
    description: "The stack's default VPC subnet ID. This parameter is required if you specify a value for the VpcId parameter. All instances are launched into this subnet unless you specify otherwise when you create the instance. If you also specify a value for DefaultAvailabilityZone, the subnet must be in that zone. For information on default values and when this parameter is required, see the VpcId parameter description. "
  CustomJson:
    type: string
    description: "A string that contains user-defined, custom JSON. It can be used to override the corresponding default stack configuration attribute values or to pass data to recipes. The string should be in the following escape characters such as ''':  '{\\'key1\\': \\'value1\\', \\'key2\\': \\'value2\\',...}'  For more information on custom JSON, see Use Custom JSON to Modify the Stack Configuration Attributes."
  ConfigurationManager:

  UseCustomCookbooks:
    type: boolean
    description: "Whether the stack uses custom cookbooks."
  UseOpsworksSecurityGroups:
    type: boolean
    description: "Whether to associate the AWS OpsWorks built-in security groups with the stack's layers. AWS OpsWorks provides a standard set of built-in security groups, one for each layer, which are associated with layers by default. With UseOpsworksSecurityGroups you can instead provide your own custom security groups. UseOpsworksSecurityGroups has the following settings:    True - AWS OpsWorks automatically associates the appropriate built-in security group with each layer (default setting). You can associate additional security groups with a layer after you create it, but you cannot delete the built-in security group.   False - AWS OpsWorks does not associate built-in security groups with layers. You must create appropriate EC2 security groups and associate a security group with each layer that you create. However, you can still manually associate a built-in security group with a layer on creation; custom security groups are required only for those layers that need custom settings.   For more information, see Create a New Stack."
  CustomCookbooksSource:
    type: object
    description: ""
  DefaultSshKeyName:
    type: string
    description: "A default Amazon EC2 key pair name. The default value is none. If you specify a key pair name, AWS OpsWorks installs the public key on the instance and you can use the private key with an SSH client to log in to the instance. For more information, see  Using SSH to Communicate with an Instance and  Managing SSH Access. You can override this setting by specifying a different key pair, or no key pair, when you  create an instance. "
  DefaultRootDeviceType:
    type: string
    description: "The default root device type. This value is the default for all instances in the stack, but you can override it when you create an instance. The default option is instance-store. For more information, see Storage for the Root Device."
  AgentVersion:
    type: string
    description: "The default AWS OpsWorks agent version. You have the following options:   Auto-update - Set this parameter to LATEST. AWS OpsWorks automatically installs new agent versions on the stack's instances as soon as they are available.   Fixed version - Set this parameter to your preferred agent version. To update the agent version, you must edit the stack configuration and specify a new version. AWS OpsWorks then automatically installs that version on the stack's instances.   The default setting is the most recent release of the agent. To specify an agent version, you must use the complete version number, not the abbreviated number shown on the console. For a list of available agent version numbers, call DescribeAgentVersions.  You can also specify an agent version when you create or update an instance, which overrides the stack's default setting. "
