If you specify a key-pair name, AWS OpsWorks installs the public key on the instance and you can use the private key with an SSH client to log in to the instance. For more information, see  Using SSH to Communicate with an Instance and  Managing SSH Access. You can override this setting by specifying a different key pair, or no key pair, when you  create an instance. "
  DefaultRootDeviceType:

  UseOpsworksSecurityGroups:
    type: boolean
    description: "Whether to associate the AWS OpsWorks built-in security groups with the stack's layers. AWS OpsWorks provides a standard set of built-in security groups, one for each layer, which are associated with layers by default. UseOpsworksSecurityGroups allows you to provide your own custom security groups instead of using the built-in groups. UseOpsworksSecurityGroups has the following settings:    True - AWS OpsWorks automatically associates the appropriate built-in security group with each layer (default setting). You can associate additional security groups with a layer after you create it, but you cannot delete the built-in security group.   False - AWS OpsWorks does not associate built-in security groups with layers. You must create appropriate EC2 security groups and associate a security group with each layer that you create. However, you can still manually associate a built-in security group with a layer on. Custom security groups are required only for those layers that need custom settings.   For more information, see Create a New Stack."
  AgentVersion:
    type: string
    description: "The default AWS OpsWorks agent version. You have the following options:   Auto-update - Set this parameter to LATEST. AWS OpsWorks automatically installs new agent versions on the stack's instances as soon as they are available.   Fixed version - Set this parameter to your preferred agent version. To update the agent version, you must edit the stack configuration and specify a new version. AWS OpsWorks then automatically installs that version on the stack's instances.   The default setting is LATEST. To specify an agent version, you must use the complete version number, not the abbreviated number shown on the console. For a list of available agent version numbers, call DescribeAgentVersions.  You can also specify an agent version when you create or update an instance, which overrides the stack's default setting. "
