  ClusterType:
    type: string
    description: " The new cluster type.   When you submit your cluster resize request, your existing cluster goes into a read-only mode. After Amazon Redshift provisions a new cluster based on your resize requirements, there will be outage for a period while the old cluster is deleted and your connection is switched to the new cluster. You can use DescribeResize to track the progress of the resize request.  Valid Values:  multi-node | single-node "
  NodeType:
    type: string
    description: " The new node type of the cluster. If you specify a new node type, you must also specify the number of nodes parameter.   When you submit your request to resize a cluster, Amazon Redshift sets access permissions for the cluster to read-only. After Amazon Redshift provisions a new cluster according to your resize requirements, there will be a temporary outage while the old cluster is deleted and your connection is switched to the new cluster. When the new connection is complete, the original access permissions for the cluster are restored. You can use DescribeResize to track the progress of the resize request.  Valid Values:  ds1.xlarge | ds1.8xlarge |  ds2.xlarge | ds2.8xlarge | dc1.large | dc1.8xlarge."
  NumberOfNodes:
    type: integer
    description: " The new number of nodes of the cluster. If you specify a new number of nodes, you must also specify the node type parameter.   When you submit your request to resize a cluster, Amazon Redshift sets access permissions for the cluster to read-only. After Amazon Redshift provisions a new cluster according to your resize requirements, there will be a temporary outage while the old cluster is deleted and your connection is switched to the new cluster.

Valid Values: Integer greater than 0."
  ClusterSecurityGroups:
    type: array
    description: " A list of cluster security groups to be authorized on this cluster. This change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible.  Security groups currently associated with the cluster, and not in the list of groups to apply, will be revoked from the cluster. Constraints:  Must be 1 to 255 alphanumeric characters or hyphens First character must be a letter Cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens "
  VpcSecurityGroupIds:
    type: array
    description: " A list of virtual private cloud (VPC) security groups to be associated with the cluster. "
  MasterUserPassword:
    type: string
    description: " The new password for the cluster master user. This change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible. Between the time of the request and the completion of the request, the MasterUserPassword element exists in the PendingModifiedValues element of the operation response.  Operations never return the password, so this operation provides a way to regain access to the master user account for a cluster if the password is lost.   Default: Uses existing setting.  Constraints:   Must be between 8 and 64 characters in length. Must contain at least one uppercase letter. Must contain at least one lowercase letter. Must contain one number. Can be any printable ASCII character (ASCII code 33 to 126) except ' (single quote), ' (double quote), \\, /, @, or space. "
  ClusterParameterGroupName:
    type: string
    description: " The name of the cluster parameter group to apply to this cluster. This change is applied only after the cluster is rebooted. To reboot a cluster use RebootCluster.  Default: Uses existing setting. Constraints: The cluster parameter group must be in the same parameter group family that matches the cluster version."
  AutomatedSnapshotRetentionPeriod:
    type: integer
    description: " The number of days that automated snapshots are retained. If the value is 0, automated snapshots are disabled. Even if automated snapshots are disabled, you can still create manual snapshots when you want with CreateClusterSnapshot.   If you decrease the automated snapshot retention period from its current value, existing automated snapshots that fall outside of the new retention period will be immediately deleted. Default: Uses existing setting. Constraints: Must be a value from 0 to 35."
  PreferredMaintenanceWindow:
    type: string
    description: " The weekly time range (in UTC) during which system maintenance can occur, if necessary. If system maintenance is necessary during the window, it may result in an outage.   This maintenance window change is made immediately. If the new maintenance window indicates the current time, there must be at least 120 minutes between the current time and end of the window in order to ensure that pending changes are applied.  Default: Uses existing setting. Format: ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi, for example wed:07:30-wed:08:00. Valid Days: Mon | Tue | Wed | Thu | Fri | Sat | Sun Constraints: Must be at least 30 minutes."
  ClusterVersion:
    type: string
    description: " The new version number of the Amazon Redshift engine to upgrade to.   For major version upgrades, if a non-default cluster parameter group is currently in use, a new cluster parameter group in the cluster parameter group family for the new version must be specified. The new cluster parameter group can be the default for that cluster parameter group family. For more information about parameters and parameter groups, go to Amazon Redshift Parameter Groups in the Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide.  Example: 1.0"
  AllowVersionUpgrade:
    type: boolean
    description: " If true, major version upgrades will be applied automatically to the cluster during the maintenance window.  Default: false"
