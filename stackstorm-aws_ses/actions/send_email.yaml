    description: "The email address that is sending the email. This email address must be either individually verified with Amazon SES, or from a domain that has been verified with Amazon SES. For information about verifying identities, see the Amazon SES Developer Guide. If you are sending on behalf of another user and have been permitted to do so by a sending authorization policy, then you must also specify the SourceArn parameter. For more information about sending authorization, see the Amazon SES Developer Guide.  In all cases, the email address must be 7-bit ASCII. If the text must contain any other characters, then you must use MIME encoded-word syntax (RFC 2047) instead of a literal string. MIME encoded-word syntax uses the following form: =?charset?encoding?encoded-text?=. For more information, see RFC 2047. "

For more information about sending authorization, see the Amazon SES Developer Guide. "
