    description: "A list of attributes to retrieve information for. The following attributes are supported:  All - returns all values. ApproximateNumberOfMessages - returns the approximate number of visible messages in a queue. For more information, see Resources Required to Process Messages in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide. ApproximateNumberOfMessagesNotVisible - returns the approximate number of messages that are not timed-out and not deleted. For more information, see Resources Required to Process Messages in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide. VisibilityTimeout - returns the visibility timeout for the queue. For more information about visibility timeout, see Visibility Timeout in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide. CreatedTimestamp - returns the time when the queue was created (epoch time in seconds). LastModifiedTimestamp - returns the time when the queue was last changed (epoch time in seconds). Policy - returns the queue's policy. MaximumMessageSize - returns the limit of how many bytes a message can contain before Amazon SQS rejects it. MessageRetentionPeriod - returns the number of seconds Amazon SQS retains a message. QueueArn - returns the queue's Amazon resource name (ARN). ApproximateNumberOfMessagesDelayed - returns the approximate number of messages that are pending to be added to the queue. DelaySeconds - returns the default delay on the queue in seconds. ReceiveMessageWaitTimeSeconds - returns the time for which a ReceiveMessage call will wait for a message to arrive. RedrivePolicy - returns the parameters for dead letter queue functionality of the source queue. For more information about RedrivePolicy and dead letter queues, see Using Amazon SQS Dead Letter Queues in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide.  Going forward, new attributes might be added. If you are writing code that calls this action, we recommend that you structure your code so that it can handle new attributes gracefully."
