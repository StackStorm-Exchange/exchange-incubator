  RoleArn:
    type: string
    description: "The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the role to assume."
    required: true
  RoleSessionName:
    type: string
    description: "An identifier for the assumed role session. Use the role session name to uniquely identify a session when the same role is assumed by different principals or for different reasons. In cross-account scenarios, the role session name is visible to, and can be logged by the account that owns the role. The role session name is also used in the ARN of the assumed role principal. This means that subsequent cross-account API requests using the temporary security credentials will expose the role session name to the external account in their CloudTrail logs. The format for this parameter, as described by its regex pattern, is a string of characters consisting of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: =,.@-"
    required: true
  Policy:
    type: string
    description: "An IAM policy in JSON format. This parameter is optional. If you pass a policy, the temporary security credentials that are returned by the operation have the permissions that are allowed by both (the intersection of) the access policy of the role that is being assumed, and the policy that you pass. This gives you a way to further restrict the permissions for the resulting temporary security credentials. You cannot use the passed policy to grant permissions that are in excess of those allowed by the access policy of the role that is being assumed. For more information, see Permissions for AssumeRole, AssumeRoleWithSAML, and AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity in the IAM User Guide. The format for this parameter, as described by its regex pattern, is a string of characters up to 2048 characters in length. The characters can be any ASCII character from the space character to the end of the valid character list (\\u0020-\\u00FF). It can also include the tab (\\u0009), linefeed (\\u000A), and carriage return (\\u000D) characters.  The policy plain text must be 2048 bytes or shorter. However, an internal conversion compresses it into a packed binary format with a separate limit. The PackedPolicySize response element indicates by percentage how close to the upper size limit the policy is, with 100% equaling the maximum allowed size. "
  DurationSeconds:
    type: integer
    description: "The duration, in seconds, of the role session. The value can range from 900 seconds (15 minutes) to 3600 seconds (1 hour). By default, the value is set to 3600 seconds."
  ExternalId:
    type: string
    description: "A unique identifier that is used by third parties when assuming roles in their customers' accounts. For each role that the third party can assume, they should instruct their customers to ensure the role's trust policy checks for the external ID that the third party generated. Each time the third party assumes the role, they should pass the customer's external ID. The external ID is useful in order to help third parties bind a role to the customer who created it. For more information about the external ID, see How to Use an External ID When Granting Access to Your AWS Resources to a Third Party in the IAM User Guide. The format for this parameter, as described by its regex pattern, is a string of characters consisting of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: =,.@:\\/-"
  SerialNumber:
    type: string
    description: "The identification number of the MFA device that is associated with the user who is making the AssumeRole call. Specify this value if the trust policy of the role being assumed includes a condition that requires MFA authentication. The value is either the serial number for a hardware device (such as GAHT12345678) or an Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a virtual device (such as arn:aws:iam::123456789012:mfa/user). The format for this parameter, as described by its regex pattern, is a string of characters consisting of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: =,.@-"
  TokenCode:
    type: string
    description: "The value provided by the MFA device, if the trust policy of the role being assumed requires MFA (that is, if the policy includes a condition that tests for MFA). If the role being assumed requires MFA and if the TokenCode value is missing or expired, the AssumeRole call returns an 'access denied' error. The format for this parameter, as described by its regex pattern, is a sequence of six numeric digits."
