  RoleArn:
    type: string
    description: "The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the role that the caller is assuming."
    required: true
  RoleSessionName:
    type: string
    description: "An identifier for the assumed role session. Typically, you pass the name or identifier that is associated with the user who is using your application. That way, the temporary security credentials that your application will use are associated with that user. This session name is included as part of the ARN and assumed role ID in the AssumedRoleUser response element. The format for this parameter, as described by its regex pattern, is a string of characters consisting of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: =,.@-"
    required: true
  WebIdentityToken:
    type: string
    description: "The OAuth 2.0 access token or OpenID Connect ID token that is provided by the identity provider. Your application must get this token by authenticating the user who is using your application with a web identity provider before the application makes an AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity call. "
    required: true
  ProviderId:
    type: string
    description: "The fully qualified host component of the domain name of the identity provider. Specify this value only for OAuth 2.0 access tokens. Currently www.amazon.com and graph.facebook.com are the only supported identity providers for OAuth 2.0 access tokens. Do not include URL schemes and port numbers. Do not specify this value for OpenID Connect ID tokens."
  Policy:
    type: string
    description: "An IAM policy in JSON format. The policy parameter is optional. If you pass a policy, the temporary security credentials that are returned by the operation have the permissions that are allowed by both the access policy of the role that is being assumed,  and  the policy that you pass. This gives you a way to further restrict the permissions for the resulting temporary security credentials. You cannot use the passed policy to grant permissions that are in excess of those allowed by the access policy of the role that is being assumed. For more information, see Permissions for AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity in the IAM User Guide.  The format for this parameter, as described by its regex pattern, is a string of characters up to 2048 characters in length. The characters can be any ASCII character from the space character to the end of the valid character list (\\u0020-\\u00FF). It can also include the tab (\\u0009), linefeed (\\u000A), and carriage return (\\u000D) characters.  The policy plain text must be 2048 bytes or shorter. However, an internal conversion compresses it into a packed binary format with a separate limit. The PackedPolicySize response element indicates by percentage how close to the upper size limit the policy is, with 100% equaling the maximum allowed size. "
  DurationSeconds:
    type: integer
    description: "The duration, in seconds, of the role session. The value can range from 900 seconds (15 minutes) to 3600 seconds (1 hour). By default, the value is set to 3600 seconds."
