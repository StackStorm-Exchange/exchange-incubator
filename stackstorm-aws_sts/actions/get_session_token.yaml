  SerialNumber:
    type: string
    description: "The identification number of the MFA device that is associated with the IAM user who is making the GetSessionToken call. Specify this value if the IAM user has a policy that requires MFA authentication. The value is either the serial number for a hardware device (such as GAHT12345678) or an Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a virtual device (such as arn:aws:iam::123456789012:mfa/user). You can find the device for an IAM user by going to the AWS Management Console and viewing the user's security credentials.  The format for this parameter, as described by its regex pattern, is a string of characters consisting of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: =,.@-"
  TokenCode:
    type: string
    description: "The value provided by the MFA device, if MFA is required. If any policy requires the IAM user to submit an MFA code, specify this value. If MFA authentication is required, and the user does not provide a code when requesting a set of temporary security credentials, the user will receive an 'access denied' response when requesting resources that require MFA authentication. The format for this parameter, as described by its regex pattern, is a sequence of six numeric digits."
