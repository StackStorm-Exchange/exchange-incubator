    required: true
  name:
    type: string
    description: "The name of the workflow type. The specified string must not start or end with whitespace. It must not contain a : (colon), / (slash), | (vertical bar), or any control characters (\\u0000-\\u001f | \\u007f - \\u009f). Also, it must not contain the literal string quotarnquot."
    required: true
  version:
    type: string
    description: "The version of the workflow type. The workflow type consists of the name and version, the combination of which must be unique within the domain. To get a list of all currently registered workflow types, use the ListWorkflowTypes action. The specified string must not start or end with whitespace. It must not contain a : (colon), / (slash), | (vertical bar), or any control characters (\\u0000-\\u001f | \\u007f - \\u009f). Also, it must not contain the literal string quotarnquot."

  defaultTaskStartToCloseTimeout:
    type: string
    description: "If set, specifies the default maximum duration of decision tasks for this workflow type. This default can be overridden when starting a workflow execution using the StartWorkflowExecution action or the StartChildWorkflowExecution decision. The duration is specified in seconds; an integer greater than or equal to 0. The value 'NONE' can be used to specify unlimited duration."
  defaultExecutionStartToCloseTimeout:
    type: string
    description: "If set, specifies the default maximum duration for executions of this workflow type. You can override this default when starting an execution through the StartWorkflowExecution action or StartChildWorkflowExecution decision. The duration is specified in seconds; an integer greater than or equal to 0. Unlike some of the other timeout parameters in Amazon SWF, you cannot specify a value of 'NONE' for defaultExecutionStartToCloseTimeout; there is a one-year max limit on the time that a workflow execution can run. Exceeding this limit will always cause the workflow execution to time out."
  defaultTaskList:
    type: object
    description: "If set, specifies the default task list to use for scheduling decision tasks for executions of this workflow type. This default is used only if a task list is not provided when starting the execution through the StartWorkflowExecution action or StartChildWorkflowExecution decision."
  defaultTaskPriority:
    type: string
    description: "The default task priority to assign to the workflow type. If not assigned, then '0' will be used. Valid values are integers that range from Java's Integer.MIN_VALUE (-2147483648) to Integer.MAX_VALUE (2147483647). Higher numbers indicate higher priority. For more information about setting task priority, see Setting Task Priority in the Amazon Simple Workflow Developer Guide."
  defaultChildPolicy:
    type: string
    description: "If set, specifies the default policy to use for the child workflow executions when a workflow execution of this type is terminated, by calling the TerminateWorkflowExecution action explicitly or due to an expired timeout. This default can be overridden when starting a workflow execution using the StartWorkflowExecution action or the StartChildWorkflowExecution decision. The supported child policies are:  TERMINATE: the child executions will be terminated. REQUEST_CANCEL: a request to cancel will be attempted for each child execution by recording a WorkflowExecutionCancelRequested event in its history. It is up to the decider to take appropriate actions when it receives an execution history with this event. ABANDON: no action will be taken. The child executions will continue to run. "
  defaultLambdaRole:
    type: string
    description: "The ARN of the default IAM role to use when a workflow execution of this type invokes AWS Lambda functions. This default can be overridden when starting a workflow execution using the StartWorkflowExecution action or the StartChildWorkflowExecution and ContinueAsNewWorkflowExecution decision."
