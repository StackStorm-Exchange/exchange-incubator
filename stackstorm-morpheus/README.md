# Morpheus Integration Pack
This pack allows you to integrate with Morpheus

## Configuration
Copy the example configuration in [morpheus.yaml.example](./morpheus.yaml.example) to
`/opt/stackstorm/configs/morpheus.yaml` and edit as required.

It must contain:

```
ipaddress - Your Morpheus Appliance IP address
username - Morpheus User name
password - Morpheus Password
dbuser  - Mongo database username
dbpass - Mongo database password
```

You can also use dynamic values from the datastore. See the
[docs](https://docs.stackstorm.com/reference/pack_configs.html) for more info.

Example configuration:

```yaml
---
  ipaddress: "10.10.10.10"
  username: "Administrator"
  password: "password"
  dbuser: "appUser"
  dbpass: "passwordForAppUser"
```
You can also run `st2 pack config morpheus` and answer the prompts

**Note** : When modifying the configuration in `/opt/stackstorm/configs/` please
           remember to tell StackStorm to load these new values by running
           `st2ctl reload --register-configs`


## Actions

### Individual actions: GET, POST, PUT with under bar will precede each individual action
* ``get_volumes``
* ``get_logs``
* ``get_networks``
* ``get_alerts``

### Orquestra Workflows: will not

This application uses the mongo db installed by StackStorm. Since the DB is secured
you will need to log into the StackStorm mongo DB as a StackStorm admin and create a separate DB

# To get this pack to work with A SINGLE HOST DEPLOYMENT StackStorm mongo DB
You can ignore this section when using StackStorm in docker containers. There is
no username and password associated with the database running in the mongo container.
Use at your own discretion.
 
```
docker pull stackstorm/stackstorm
```

log in with admin first
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
mongo -u admin -p UkIbDILcNbMhkh3KtN6xfr9h admin  (passwd in /etc/st2/st2.config)

# Then create a new user
db.createUser({user: "appUser",pwd: "passwordForAppUser",roles: [ { role: "readWrite", db: "app_db" } ]})

# Then if necessary you can check the mongo database records by
mongo -u appUser -p passwordForAppUser admin

# Servicenow Tables
